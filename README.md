Pymaceuticals Challenge

Overview
Pymaceuticals is a fictious new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. This script uses Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze a study of 249 mice with tumors that received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. This analysis generates summary statistics, creates bar and pie charts, calculates quartiles, finds outliers, creates box, line, and scatter plots, and calculates correlation and regression.
